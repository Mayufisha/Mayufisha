## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a frontend-focused full-stack developer with a love for solving complex problems and designing user-friendly interfaces.  
My journey started coding on mobile devices (HTML, CSS, JS), then expanded into React, Python, and C++.  
When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring UI/UX design in Figma and occasionally playing chess ♟️.
